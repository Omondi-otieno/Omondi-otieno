ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm James Omondi
I'm an AI & LLM Specialist and Full-Stack Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Iâ€™ve worked with Meta and Google to train, evaluate, and improve LLMs for code generation (Python, JavaScript, SQL), and I also integrate AI into practical applications like medical ERP systems using Django, React, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy experimenting with Transformers, deploying apps with Docker and AWS, and making complex AI systems easier to understand and use.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python, JavaScript, React, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Transformers
ðŸ“š Interests: LLM training & evaluation, AI system integration, full-stack development
